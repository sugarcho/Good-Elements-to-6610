## Project Overview

This project demonstrates two complementary approaches to automated research news collection and summarization:

1. **AutoGPT Agent** - Interactive, AI-powered news discovery
2. **Python Pipeline** - Batch processing and deep analysis

### Key Insights

**From AutoGPT Agent Development:**
- Perplexity API is excellent for real-time research news
- AI structured response generation significantly improves data quality

**Borrowed and Adapted to Python Pipeline:**
- `perplexity_collector.py`: Adapted from `blocks/perplexity.py`
- `ai_extractor.py`: Adapted by `blocks/llm.py`
- `topic_discovery.py`: Adapted by `blocks/llm.py` annd concept from AI text generation blocks
